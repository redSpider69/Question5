                        <b>Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines plagiarism as follows:</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as ones own: to use (anothers production) without crediting the source
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Many people think plagiarism is stealing someone elses words, but it also means stealing someone elses ideas. In other words, even if you paraphrase a text, the idea still needs to be cited.</li>
                        <li>The phrase without crediting the source means that its okay to use the words and ideas of others, but you have to cite the source to avoid committing plagiarism.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Types of plagiarism</h3>
                    <p>Plagiarism takes various forms. It ranges from reusing an entire document to rewriting a single paragraph. In the end, all types of plagiarism come down to passing off someone elses ideas or words as your own.</p>
                    <p>Common types of plagiarism</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Copy-and-paste plagiarism</b>
                            <p>Copy-and-paste plagiarism, also known as direct plagiarism, means using a paragraph from another source without a citation.</p>
                            <p>If you really want to include a passage from another source word for word, you should learn how to quote it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Mosaic plagiarism</b>
                            <p>
                                Copying and pasting different pieces of text together to create a kind of mosaic or patchwork of other researchers ideas is plagiarism.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although the result is a completely new piece of text, the words and ideas arent new
                            </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Self-plagiarism</b>
                            <p>
                                When you use parts of your previous work (e.g. a paper, a literature review or a dataset) without properly citing it, you commit whats called self-plagiarism.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although it sounds a bit crazy to be penalized for plagiarizing your own work, you should know that it is done because it goes against the expectations of the readers of your paper. They expect the work to be original.    
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Global plagiarism
                            </b>
                            <p>
                                When you use someone elses paper, you are committing plagiarism because you are pretending that the words and ideas are yours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using someone elses work includes, for example, having a friend or family write the text for you or buying an essay from a so-called essay mill.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Consequences of plagiarism</h3>
                    <p>
                        The consequences of plagiarism depend on the type of plagiarism and whether youre a first-year student, an experienced academic or a working professional.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Failing the course</li>
                        <li>Expulsion or suspension from your university</li>
                        <li>Copyright infringement</li>
                        <li>Ruined reputation and potentially the end of your career</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How to detect plagiarism</h3>
                    <p>Detecting plagiarism isnt too difficult. Either the reader of your text notices a change in tone and writing style when reading a passage or uses plagiarism detection tools.</p>
                    <p>
                        These days, all documents submitted to a university or journal are automatically checked for plagiarism using software like Turnitin. Turnitin is the leading company in plagiarism detection software.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How do plagiarism checkers work?</h4>
                    <p>Plagiarism checkers compare your document to a database of existing texts. The plagiarism software searches for similarities and highlights passages that contain potential plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>
                        Not all plagiarism checkers are reliable. Where one plagiarism checker detects 2% plagiarism, another might detect 45% plagiarism.
                    </p>
                    <p>The accuracy of plagiarism depends on two things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Database size</li>
                        <li>Plagiarism algorithm</li>
                    </ol>
